# graal-springboot-war-deployment
GraalVM benchmarking test using Spring Boot WAR deployment on any Application Server that already support Servlet Speciftion 4.0 and above such as Weblogic 14c, Tomcat 9, Wildfly 14 and above, etc

Note that in this test I am not (yet) utilizing Servlet spec 4.0 feature e.g. Server Push in HTTP/2. This is just a skeleton for my RESTful demo, but could possibly be enhanced to meet more benchmarking test in future.
